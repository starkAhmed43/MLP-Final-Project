# MLP-Final-Project
Final Project towards completion of the Machine Learning Practices course of the IITM BS Degree in Data Science &amp; Applications

This is a classification problem that I have solved using a Random Forest classifier.

The code is available in both .py as well as .ipynb formats.

I have also included the datasets upon which the code was trained and tested.
